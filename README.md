Here's a **README.md** template for your project with instructions for setting up and using the `setup.py`, `send.py`, and `read.py` scripts. This assumes the project involves sending messages to SNS and receiving messages from SQS, with region and account ID dynamically handled.

# SNS-SQS Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to send a message to an SNS topic and then read it from an SQS queue, using `send.py` to send messages and `read.py` to receive and delete them. The region and account ID are dynamically handled to make the scripts adaptable to any AWS environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: You must have an active AWS account.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure AWS CLI with the appropriate credentials (`aws configure`).
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **Boto3**: The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) is required to interact with AWS services like SNS and SQS.

To install Boto3, run:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com//aafaq-rashid-comprinno/sns-sqs-integration.git
cd sns-sqs-integration
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (optional)

If you're managing dependencies with a `setup.py` file, install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install .
```

This will install Boto3 and any other required packages from the `setup.py`.

### 3. Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will ask for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format.

Alternatively, you can set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable to specify the region, or leave it unset to default to `us-east-1`:

```bash
export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'  # Linux/macOS
set AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # Windows Command Prompt
```

### 4. Run the Scripts

#### **send.py**: Sending Messages to SNS

This script sends a message to an SNS topic. The region and account ID are fetched dynamically.

To use `send.py`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you've created an SNS topic in your AWS account.
2. Replace `MySNSTopic` in the script with the name of your SNS topic.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python send.py
```

The script will send a test message to the SNS topic.

#### **read.py**: Receiving Messages from SQS

This script receives messages from an SQS queue and deletes them after processing.

To use `read.py`, follow these steps:

1. Create an SQS queue in your AWS account.
2. Replace `MySQSQueue` in the script with the name of your SQS queue.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python read.py
```

The script will receive one message from the SQS queue and delete it after processing.

### 5. Dynamic Region and Account ID

Both `send.py` and `read.py` automatically fetch the AWS region and account ID. The region can be configured using the `AWS_REGION` environment variable. The account ID is retrieved using AWS STS.

If you don't specify a region, the scripts default to `us-east-1`.
